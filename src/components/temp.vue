</v-card-text><v-row justify="center"> <v-card-title class="text-h4 title">Adhesion system  </v-card-title></v-row>
<v-card-title class="text-h5">Overview</v-card-title>
<v-card-text>  <p class = "body-1">The first system of MIBOM is the adhesion system. We got inspiration from a magical molecule, mussel foot protein 5, which plays a major role in the adhesion of MIBOM. However, the productivity of extracting natural mfp5 from mussels is so low that only 1 milligram of mfp5 can be extracted from 10000 mussels. Therefore, we designed several steps below to achieve high-yield and effective mfp5 manufacture based on the principles of synthetic biology.</p>
<p class = "body-1">1. construction of mfp5 vector</p>
<p class = "body-1">2. purification and *in vitro* modification of mfp5</p>
</v-card-text><v-card-title class="text-h5">Construction</v-card-title>
<v-card-text>  <p class = "body-1">The designed gene named mfp5-2 has three important parts. First,  the AKTK expression tag is on the 5' end of the gene, which may facilitate the expression of Mfp5. Secondly, 6*His tag is used to purify mfp5 by affinity chromatography. Finally, two repeats of the natural mfp5 gene follow the His-tag. The previous study has proved that the amino acid length and tyrosine concentration in the mussel foot proteins affect its adhesive capacity.</p>
<p class = "body-1">Our goal is to make the yield of mfp5-2 as high as possible, so we choose the BL21(DE3) strain to be our expression chasis because the RNA polymerase of T7 phage is integrated into the genome of BL21(DE3), adapting to pET 28a vector. The T7 promoter in this vector is a strong promoter, which can efficiently express mfp5-2. Therefore, we cloned the mfp5-2 gene into pET 28a to make a recombinant vector.</p>
</v-card-text><v-card-title class="text-h5">Purification and modification</v-card-title>
<v-card-text>  <p class = "body-1">With the aim to get mfp5-2 with high-yield and high-purity effectively, we need to explore the proper inducing conditions, proper buffers and proper protocols of purification.</p>
<p class = "body-1">Mfp5-2 is a special protein that has obviously distinct properties compared with other soluble proteins. First, since the length of Mfp5-2 is quite short and its natural form contains irregular structures, the induced BL21(DE3)need to be cultured at 37° for 8-10 hours to get the highest expression. Moreover, most Mfp5-2 exist as the form of inclusion body in BL21(DE3), which means denaturation is required to dissolve all the insoluble mfp5-2.</p>
<p class = "body-1">The modification of mfp5-2 employs tyrosinase, whose function is to catalyze the oxidate of tyrosine residues into DOPA groups, The two hydroxyl groups on the benzene ring of DOPA can form non-covalent bonds on the surface of other materials in the aqueous environment. However, the optimal pH of tyrosinase, which is around 6.0, indicates that we need to pick a proper salt to make the buffer system.</p>
</v-card-text><v-card-title class="text-h6">Preparation of buffers</v-card-title>
<v-card-text>  <p class = "body-1">We prepare many kinds of buffers for different processes.</p>
<p class = "body-1">Lysis Buffer: 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mM potassium phosphates, 300 sodium chloride, pH 7.4</p>
<p class = "body-1">Wash Buffer: 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mM potassium phosphates, 300 sodium chloride, 50 mM imidazole pH 7.4</p>
<p class = "body-1">Elution Buffer: 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mM potassium phosphates, 300 sodium chloride, 250 mM imidazole pH 7.4</p>
<p class = "body-1">Dialysis Buffer: 100 mM sodium acetate, 100 mM scorbic acid, pH 5.5</p>
</v-card-text><v-card-title class="text-h">Induction</v-card-title>
<v-card-text>  <p class = "body-1">The BL21(DE3) is cultured in a 1L system. We use IPTG to initiate the expression of Mfp5-2 when the OD is 0.8-1.0, and the final concentration of IPTG is 1 mM. Then, BL21(DE3) is kept at 37℃, 220 rpm for 8-10 hours.</p>
</v-card-text><v-card-title class="text-h">purification</v-card-title>
<v-card-text>  <p class = "body-1">The harvested BL21 is resuspended by lysis buffer and lysed by ultrasound to make mfp5-2 have full contact with lysis buffer. Insoluble mfp5-2 will then quickly dissolve in the buffer. Then centrifugation is needed to separate the supernatant, containing mfp5-2, from sediment. The supernatant is then loaded into the nickel affinity chromatography column, The his tag of mfp5-2 from a strong connection with the nickel column while other proteins just flow through. Then wash buffer is used to clear other proteins and elution buffer is used to elute mfp5-2.</p>
</v-card-text><v-card-title class="text-h">Modification</v-card-title>
<v-card-text>  <p class = "body-1">The pH of the eluted mfp5-2 solution is 7.4, which may greatly affect the activity of tyrosinase. So mfp5-2 needs to be dialyzed in dialysis buffer to replace its dissolvant. Then, add proper tyrosinase is added to the mfp5-2 solution to modify tyrosine. </p>
</v-card-text><v-row justify="center"> <v-card-title class="text-h4 title">Hydrogel system  </v-card-title></v-row>
<v-card-title class="text-h5">Overview</v-card-title>
<v-card-text>  <p class = "body-1">For a complete system, the adhesion system only provides adhesive ability but does not have cohesion, so the Mfp-5 itself can not adjoin objects together. In other words, the Mfp-5 itself is just a kind of slightly viscous liquid, if you want it to adjoin objects, you need to wait for a very long time(about 24h) until it is completely dry(See our results on [Results](https://2021.igem.org/Team:ShanghaiTech_China/Results) page ). The principle is simple: Mfp itself is more like a kind of glue that is hard to cure unless it is dried. However, in clinical scenarios, dry conditions are impossible, and even it is completely dry, it performs less adhesion ability than common glue. That is also the reason why mussel protein's applications are more about wound repair. To overcome the cohesion and structural strength problem, we designed a hydrogel system to be the second system of MIBOM. This system makes it possible for Mfp to be a "real" glue and makes it friendly for clinicians to operate. </p>
<p class = "body-1">However, the way to solidify the gel is important. Setting times of an orthopedic adhesive are of great importance in practical application.[^2-1] Reversible adhesiveness is essential to provide ample working window for surgeons to splice fragments which need repeated adjustments for full reduction.[^2-2] This is consistent with our interview results. After many iterations, we decided on a dual-crosslinking system, consisting of a photo-crosslinking system and an ionic-crosslinking system</p>
</v-card-text><v-card-title class="text-h5">Photo-crosslinking system</v-card-title>
<v-card-title class="text-h6">Overview</v-card-title>
<v-card-text>  <p class = "body-1">Some papers have developed some flexible osteogenic glue based on the mixing of several reagents[^2-1]. But actually, the extended setting process could take up extensive time during operation which is obviously unfavored, and too fast setting of the adhesive could also leave surgeon insufficient time to prepare and fully mixing adhesive components which are also not desired[^2-3]. So we decide to change the strategy and introduce a photo-crosslinking network to make the curing completely controllable.</p>
</v-card-text><v-card-title class="text-h6">Preparation of GelMA</v-card-title>
<v-card-text>  <p class = "body-1">Gelatin-methacryloyl(GelMA) with a moderate degree of methacryloyl modification was proved to have good biocompatibility and suitable for photo-crosslinking[^2-4]. And it provides a broad spectrum of tunable parameters, which lead to the creation of hydrogel networks with different stiffness and pore architectures[^2-5][^2-6][^2-7][^2-8]. Based on these advantages, we chose GelMA as our ideal monomer. At first, we want to purchase GelMA from the company, but due to financial constraints, we had to make the preparation of GelMA by ourselves. We prepared the GelMA with different degrees of methacryloyl modification by adding a different portion of acrylic anhydride to the gelatin solution. We used Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy-1H(NMR-1H) to test our product and a relatively pure GelMA was obtained.</p>
</v-card-text><v-card-title class="text-h6">Selection of photoinitiators</v-card-title>
<v-card-text>  <p class = "body-1">We chose the LAP(lithium phenyl-2,4,6-trimethyl-benzoyl-phosphinate) as our ideal photoinitiators. LAP has the advantage of fast initiation and longer excitation wavelength which is good for the internal environment. LAP enables GelMA to polymerize rapidly in a few seconds. The 405nm wavelength excitation light makes the tissues and cells less affected. We have done some experiments to prove its least harm to the cells.</p>
</v-card-text><v-card-title class="text-h6">Phototoxicity test</v-card-title>
<v-card-text>  <p class = "body-1">We had concerned that 405nm excitation light will kill the cells during the solidification. So we designed a phototoxicity test to see the influence of light. We tested phototoxicity by directly irradiating cells for 10s, 30s and 60s. This irradiation time is much longer than the need for curing. </p>
</v-card-text><v-card-title class="text-h6">Live/dead staining with FDA and PI</v-card-title>
<v-card-text>  <p class = "body-1">Live/dead staining can be performed with Fluorescein diacetate(FDA) and Propidium Iodide(PI). FDA is taken up by cells that convert the non-fluorescent FDA into the green fluorescent metabolite fluorescein. The measured signal serves as the indicator for viable cells, as the conversion is esterase-dependent. In contrast, the nuclei staining dye PI cannot pass through a viable cell membrane. It reaches the nucleus by passing through disordered areas of dead cell membranes and intercalates with the DNA double helix of the cell.</p>
</v-card-text><v-card-title class="text-h5">Ionic-crosslinking system</v-card-title>
<v-card-title class="text-h6">Overview</v-card-title>
<v-card-text>  <p class = "body-1">The first layer network is designed to fastly cure the gel and the second layer of the network is designed to improve the structural strength after all fixations are finished. Alginate is widely used among iGEM teams, it can form an ionic-crosslinking network by calcium. We also used alginate to test the viability of cells in the hydrogel.</p>
</v-card-text><v-card-title class="text-h6">Viability of cells in hydrogel</v-card-title>
<v-card-text>  <p class = "body-1">In our design, the transformed force-sensitive cells are needed to be encapsulated into the hydrogel. Although a number of papers have shown cells' viability in hydrogels such as GelMA and Alginate[^2-4][^2-5][^2-6][^2-7], We need to make sure that the cells survive until callus formation. However, due to the epidemic, we were unable to obtain GelMA at first, so we choose the alginate to test cells' viability in the hydrogel. The cells are encapsulated into the hydrogel and we do this 3D culture for 21 days. Live/dead staining was done with FDA/PI to get a survival curve. The same as the ways mentioned above.</p>
</v-card-text><v-card-title class="text-h5">Rheological properties</v-card-title>
<v-card-text>  <p class = "body-1">Rheological properties are important to prove if our material is qualified for bone repair. We contacted the professor of the school of materials and borrowed the rheometer to test the rheological properties. All rheological properties are measured by the TA Discovery HR-2 hybrid rheometer. We also test the change of Rheological properties during photo-crosslinking and compare other new osteogenic glue with our MIBOM.</p>
</v-card-text><v-row justify="center"> <v-card-title class="text-h4 title">Stress-sensitive regulation system  </v-card-title></v-row>
<v-card-title class="text-h5">Overview</v-card-title>
<v-card-text>  <p class = "body-1">The degradation of the biomaterial is important. Although the GelMA and Alginate are all degradable materials, the rate of degradation is important during bone recovery. We also consider a problem that is often ignored: the recovery time of people of different ages is different. We tried to find a relatively "smart" regulation system to control the degradation of materials with bone growth. We found that with the growth of bone, the gel would be squeezed. The force exerted on the gel can be the signal for material degradation. But stress-induced pathways in the eukaryotic cell have never been designed or used before among all iGEM teams, which is a creative and challenging work. Our designs are as follows:</p>
</v-card-text><v-card-title class="text-h5">Mechanical sensor Piezo1</v-card-title>
<v-card-text>  <p class = "body-1">Mechanical stimuli drive many physiological processes, including touch and pain sensation, hearing, and blood pressure regulation. Piezo1 is one of the mechanosensitive cation-selective channels found in higher eukaryotic cells.[^3-1] Its broad role in mechanotransduction caught our attention. When researchers applied pressure to cells with Piezo1 proteins, a significant current change could be observed[^3-2], because Piezo1 channels were mechanically activated and induce the permeation of calcium ions. </p>
<p class = "body-1">In our design, we made use of the sensitivity to the mechanical force of Piezo1 by expressing the channels in our engineering cells. In this way, the cells in the hydrogel are able to respond to the outer force, which obviously exists during the healing process of fractured bones, and regulate the subsequent pathway. </p>
<p class = "body-1">Based on a proposed "plug-and-latch" mechanism for gating Piezo1, the structure of Piezo1 has been improved (and termed Piezo1.1) to optimize its single-channel conductance and sensitized mechanosensitivity.[^3-3] We are grateful to get the plasmid with gene of Piezo1.1 from the professor in charge of the original work. Piezo1.1 and a red fluorescent protein mRuby2 after it is placed on one plasmid.</p>
</v-card-text><v-card-title class="text-h5">Calcium ion detection</v-card-title>
<v-card-text>  <p class = "body-1">We used a genetically encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP6m, to test whether calcium entered cells after mechanical stimulations as we expected. GCaMP6m consists of a circularly permuted GFP (cpGFP), calmodulin (CaM), and a calmodulin-binding peptide(CBP). Without calcium, GCaMP6m only has very low emitted light. When four calciums attach to CaM, the conformation of cpGFP will be changed, which lead to an obvious increase of emitted light at 510nm. We inserted it after CMV promoter using pEGFP as the backbone, to make sure GCaMP6m can be expressed in our cells. </p>
</v-card-text><v-card-title class="text-h5">Downstream pathway induced by calcium ion</v-card-title>
<v-card-text>  <p class = "body-1">The great change in calcium ion concentration finally increases the expression of the enzyme through a long pathway. </p>
<p class = "body-1">Calmodulin, also vividly called a calcium-binding messenger protein by some, is a ubiquitous protein found in all tissues examined thus far.[^3-4] With the binding of three calcium ions, the calmodulin molecule can then activate one calcineurin molecule.[^3-5] Calcineurin is a serine/threonine phosphatase. Upon activation by calmodulin, calcineurin dephosphorylates the cytoplasmic nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). </p>
<p class = "body-1">NFAT is usually phosphorylated by kinases such as DYRK, CK1, and GSK3 in the cytoplasm, whereas dephosphorylation of NFATs exposes a nuclear localization signal which causes NFATs to be imported into the nucleus.[^3-6] Then NFATs in the nucleus recognize specific DNA sequences——the NFAT-response elements (REs), derived from IL2/8 promoter——in the promoter region of the target genes, and bind to the sequence by cooperating with partner transcription factors such as AP-1.[^3-7]  In our design, we use plasmid pGL4.30, where our target genes are driven by 3 repeats of IL2 promoter ( **IL2 NFAT-RE**). The binding of nuclear NFATs and NFAT-REs promote the expression of the downstream enzyme gene and also the number of enzymes. </p>
</v-card-text><v-card-title class="text-h5">Pathway verification</v-card-title>
<v-card-text>  <p class = "body-1">We construct a downstream plasmid contains NFAT-RE and a report gene after it. In our design, the reporter gene is the alginate enzyme. When Piezo1 is activated, alginate enzymes are secreted out of the cells and degrade the surrounding hydrogel. To verify the pathway, we change the report gene to a green fluorescent protein EGFP. The colocalization of two fluorescent proteins can help us to verify the downstream pathway. See our results on our [Results](https://2021.igem.org/Team:ShanghaiTech_China/Results) page.</p>
</v-card-text><v-card-title class="text-h5">Alginate enzyme</v-card-title>
<v-card-text>  <p class = "body-1">Alginate enzyme can degrade alginate, and its product is alginate Disaccharide, trisaccharide, and tetrasaccharide. Through literature reading, we found an article applying alginate enzyme to sodium alginate degradation, but the article is alginate enzyme expressed in *E. coli*[^3-8]. Because we need to express and secrete alginate enzyme after eukaryotic cells are stimulated by stress in the process of bone repair, we replaced the secretory peptide of prokaryotes with the secretory signal of interleukin-2 commonly used by mammalian cells at the N- end of alginate enzyme, hoping to guide mammalian cells to secrete alginate enzyme through signal peptide. In the process of gene design, in addition to adding signal peptide at the N end of the alginate enzyme, we also added GFP at the C end to characterize the normal expression of the alginate enzyme.</p>
